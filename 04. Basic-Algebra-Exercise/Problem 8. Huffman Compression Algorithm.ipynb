    "### A. Basics of Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoding means to convert the text in some other format.We generally perform encoding for reducing the size of the file.Suppose a text file is available then we can convert the text file in some other format which might be taking less space i.e. we can convert each character in the file in the form of binary string. Converting in the form of binary string would be beneficial because to store a binary 0 or 1 we need only one bit but to store a character we need 8 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**There are two types of encoding:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fixed-Length Encoding:** In this method, each character is represented by a fixed length binary codes.\n",
    "2. **Variable-Length Encoding:** In this method, each character is represented by a variable length binary codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the encoding techniques would definetly reduce the size of the file but Variable-Length encoding is better than Fixed-Length encoding.Let's understand this with an example.Suppose there is a file for which we have created a table representing the frequency of each character as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Symbol | A | B | C | D | E | F |\n",
    "| :------ | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| Count | 45 | 11 | 6 | 16 | 100 | 50 |\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Fixed-Length Encoding\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "With this approach we assign each character binary codes of fixed length. Since there are 6 characters we need 3 bits to store each character uniquely. So, total bits required to store the whole file is: **(45 + 11 + 6 + 16 + 100 + 50) = 684 bits.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Variable-Length Encoding\"**\n",
    "Since in this method each chracter is being assigned variable length binary code so what we try here is to assign frequent characters short code words and unfrequent characters long code words. Consider the scheme: **a = 10, b = 100, c = 101, d = 110, e = 1, f = 11**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, total bits required to store the whole file is **(45.2 + 11.3 + 6.3 + 16.3 + 100.1 + 50.2) = 389 bits.**\n",
    "\n",
    "One can easily see the difference between the spaces required to store a file using\n",

These entropy encoders then compress data by replacing each fixed-length input symbol with the corresponding variable-length prefix-free output codeword.

    "### A. Pros\n",
    "* This encoding scheme results in saving lot of storage space, since the binary codes generated are variable in length\n",
    "\n",
    "* It generates shorter binary codes for encoding symbols/characters that appear more frequently in the input string\n",
    "\n",
    "* The binary codes generated are prefix-free\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lossless data encoding schemes, like Huffman encoding, achieve a lower compression ratio compared to lossy encoding techniques. Thus, lossless techniques like Huffman encoding are suitable only for encoding text and program files and are unsuitable for encoding digital images.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Huffman encoding is a relatively slower process since it uses two passes - one for building the statistical model, and another for encoding. Thus, the lossless techniques that use Huffman encoding are considerably slower than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Since length of all the binary codes is different, it becomes difficult for the decoding software to detect whether the encoded data is corrupt. This can result in an incorrect decoding and subsequently, a wrong output."

    "* Huffman encoding is widely used in compression formats like **GZIP**, **PKZIP** (winzip) and **BZIP2**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multimedia codecs like **JPEG**, **PNG** and **MP3** uses Huffman encoding (to be more precised the prefix codes)\n",
